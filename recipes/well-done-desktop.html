    <p> Above are some examples of how your well-done desktop might look when ready for <b>consumption!</b></p>
    <h2>Required Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Grab your nearest desktop (Alienware cooks best).</li>
        <li>Make sure to take out every fan (will speed up cooking process).</li>
        <li>Add two RTX 4090's and one i9-13900K, with the cheapest power supply you can find.</li>
        <li>To preheat to 120 degrees celcius, we can simply boot up Crysis with a 16k youtube video in the background for a quick stress test.</li>
        <li>After we have hit sufficient temperature, we can shove a couple paint cans in the desktop case.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Optional Steps:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Fire extinguisher (Extra flavour).</li>
    </ul>
